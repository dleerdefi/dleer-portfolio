# Analysis Prompt for kyrre.dev Portfolio Architecture

## Context
I'm building a portfolio website with a parallax scrolling layout that features a "glass elevator" / "infinity pool" visual effect. I need to understand how kyrre.dev (https://www.kyrre.dev/) implements their scrolling content fade effect with dotted gradients.

## Repository to Analyze
https://github.com/kyrregjerstad/portfolio

## Specific Questions

### 1. Layer Architecture
- What is the complete z-index/layer stacking order in the kyrre.dev site?
- Where do the dotted gradient patterns sit in the layer hierarchy?
- How are background, border frame, content, and overlay layers organized?

### 2. Dotted Gradient Implementation
- Where exactly is the dotted gradient pattern defined in the codebase?
- What CSS properties create the dot pattern (radial-gradient, background-size, etc.)?
- Is it a fixed overlay, or does it scroll with content?
- What z-index/stacking context is used for the dots?

### 3. "Glass Elevator" Scroll Effect
- How does content become visible through the dots when scrolling out of view?
- Is there a mask, opacity transition, or clip-path involved?
- Where is the clipping boundary for scrolling content?
- Are the dots in the outer background (margin area) or as an overlay on content?

### 4. Border and Frame Architecture
- How is the main content window/frame bordered?
- What's the relationship between:
  - The outer viewport edge
  - Any border/frame element
  - The interior content area
  - The dotted gradient zones
- Are there specific pixel measurements for spacing?

### 5. Scroll Container Setup
- How is the main scrolling container configured?
- Does it use `overflow: hidden`, `clip-path`, or another clipping method?
- What are the exact positioning values (top, left, right, bottom, inset)?
- Is there overflow that extends into the margin/border area?

### 6. Visual Effect Breakdown
When content scrolls out of the visible area:
- Does it disappear abruptly or fade gradually?
- At what point does it start becoming visible through dots?
- Is the effect at the top edge the same as the bottom edge?
- Are there different opacity values or blend modes involved?

### 7. Key Files to Examine
Please identify and analyze:
- Main layout component files
- CSS/styling files that handle the scroll effect
- Any background or overlay components
- Border/frame components
- Scroll container configuration

### 8. Code Patterns
Please extract:
- Complete CSS for the dotted gradient pattern
- Z-index values for all major layers
- Positioning styles for frame, content, and overlays
- Any JavaScript that controls scroll behavior or visibility
- Mask or clip-path implementations

## Desired Output
Please provide:
1. A clear explanation of the layer architecture with z-index values
2. Code snippets showing the dotted gradient implementation
3. Explanation of how the "visible through dots" effect is achieved
4. Measurements and spacing values used
5. Step-by-step breakdown of what happens when content scrolls out of view
6. Any important CSS properties or techniques I should implement

## My Current Architecture (for reference)
- Outer background: z-index -10
- Border frame: 12px inset from viewport, 2px width, z-index 50
- Interior background: 14px inset, z-index -1
- Content sections: 14px inset, z-index 10
- Scroll container clips at 14px (border inner edge)

I need to understand where and how to add the dotted gradient effect to achieve the kyrre.dev visual style.
