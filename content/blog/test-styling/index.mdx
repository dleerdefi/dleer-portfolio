## Beautiful Typography

This is a test post to demonstrate the new typography system. The font should be a beautiful sans-serif (not monospace), and code blocks should have proper syntax highlighting.

### Code Example

Here's some JavaScript with proper syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Calculate the 10th Fibonacci number
const result = fibonacci(10);
console.log(`Fibonacci(10) = ${result}`);
```

### More Code

TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const users: User[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" },
];

function getUserById(id: number): User | undefined {
  return users.find(user => user.id === id);
}
```

### Inline Code

This is a paragraph with some `inline code` that should have accent coloring.

### Lists

Regular list items:

- First item with some text
- Second item with more content
- Third item for good measure

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote to test how quotes are styled in the new typography system.

##Human: I think I was asking for maybe a little more outside the box thinking here. make the blog really engaging and professional. I know you tried but I don't think its working
