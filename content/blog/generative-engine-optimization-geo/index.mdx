<Admonition type="info" title="The Paradigm Shift">
For over two decades, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) was the definitive playbook for getting found online. That world is being distilled.

</Admonition>

## Introduction

For over two decades, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) was the definitive playbook for getting found online. It was a discipline of engineering pages and links to win valuable positions on a search engine results page (SERP).

That world is being distilled. The list of ten blue links is collapsing into a single, synthesized answer produced by AI systems that remember context and converse with the user.
In this shift, the success metric isn't "rank #1"–it's ["get cited by the model."](https://a16z.com/geo-over-seo/)

This new discipline is [**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**](https://a16z.com/geo-over-seo/): the practice of optimizing your content, data, and brand so they are included and referenced *inside* [AI-generated answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735), not just [listed beneath them](https://a16z.com/newsletter/may-2025-enterprise/).

This is not a cosmetic rebrand of SEO. Traditional search was built on a foundation of **hyperlinks**; GEO is built on **language models**–systems that assemble meaning across countless sources to answer a query directly in the chat box. The strategic implication is profound: the art of "being found" is becoming the science of ["being remembered."](https://a16z.com/newsletter/may-2025-enterprise/)

This shift is driven by a fundamental economic inversion. The classic Google-SEO relationship was symbiotic; Google's ad-driven model *depended* on referring users *away* from the SERP to publisher sites. The new generative engine model is often subscription-based. Platforms like ChatGPT have a business model that *depends* on retaining users *in-app* by providing a complete, definitive answer.

This makes the publisher-engine relationship inherently adversarial. The AI is economically disincentivized from sending users to your site. Your content must now be so authoritative, well-structured, and indispensable that the AI is *forced* to cite you to maintain the quality and credibility of its own answer.

This paradigm shift rewrites the entire playbook.

## Classic SEO vs Generative Engine Optimization

The differences are stark, touching everything from core objectives to the KPIs we use to measure success.

| Dimension | Classic SEO | Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Foundation** | Hyperlinks & PageRank | Language models & semantic synthesis |
| **Core objective** | Rank on a SERP | Be *used/cited* inside AI answers |
| **Primary levers** | Keywords, backlinks, technical SEO | Depth, structure-for-extraction, topical corpora, earned mentions |
| **Economic model** | Ad-driven referral out to sites | Subscription/retention–answers kept in-app |
| **KPIs** | Position, CTR, organic sessions | Citations/mentions in AI, "share of AI voice," appearance rate |

## GEO Glossary

Before we dive in, here are the core concepts you need to understand for this new playbook.

<Collapsible title="Complete GEO Glossary">

* **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):** The practice of optimizing your content, data, and brand so they are included and referenced *inside* AI-generated answers, not just listed beneath them.
* **Query Fan-Out:** The process where an AI engine decomposes a single user prompt (e.g., "best laptop for college") into numerous, specific sub-queries (e.g., "best budget laptops," "Dell vs. Apple for students," "laptop battery life reviews") to retrieve a comprehensive set of sources.
* **Synthesis & Grounding:** The final step where the LLM reads all the retrieved source documents, summarizes the key facts, writes a single coherent answer, and provides citations for the information it used.
* **Real-Time Citability (Front 1):** The battle for visibility in consumer-facing chat apps (like ChatGPT Search). Winning here depends on freshness, clear content structure, and strong indexing on search engines like Bing.
* **Long-Term Brand Encoding (Front 2):** The battle for visibility in raw API models (like GPT-4o). Winning here means your brand and expertise are "baked in" to the model's training data, which relies on authoritative, unlinked brand mentions and PR.
* **Structure-for-Extraction:** The practice of formatting content not just for human scannability, but for machine *legibility*. This means using fact-dense writing, clear H2/H3s, bulleted lists, tables, and explicit Q&A pairs so an AI can easily parse and cite your data.

</Collapsible>

## How AI *Actually* Finds You

To win this new game, you must first understand how these engines *really* work. They are not alternate search engines with parallel indexes. They are orchestration layers that run retrieval pipelines on top of the [**existing web**](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/).

A typical flow for a generative query unfolds in a three-step process:

### The Query Fan-Out Process

<Window title="AI Retrieval Pipeline">

**Step 1: Query Fan-Out**
The user's natural-language prompt (e.g., "What's the best CRM for a mid-market SaaS company?") is decomposed by the AI into numerous, specific sub-queries. These might include: "Salesforce vs. HubSpot pricing," "CRM implementation tips for SaaS," and "best CRM for B2B marketing."

**Step 2: External Search**
Those sub-queries are then executed on a traditional web index. For ChatGPT's Search feature, this is [Microsoft Bing](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/) ([as confirmed by OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10093903-chatgpt-search-for-enterprise-and-edu)). The AI retrieves a set of ranked source documents–the same blog posts and articles we optimize for SEO.

**Step 3: Synthesis & Grounding**
The LLM summarizes the key facts from the selected sources, writes one coherent narrative answer, and (critically) [**cites** the most influential documents it used](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735).

</Window>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Critical Insight">
The "Query Fan-Out" mechanism is precisely why a single #1 ranking is no longer enough to carry your brand. If an AI executes 10 sub-queries, it retrieves 10 sets of source documents. It then builds its answer from the *combination* of those sources.
</Admonition>

Your goal is no longer to win a single query; it's to win the **entire semantic cluster**. If you only rank for "best CRM" but a competitor has strong pages for "CRM pricing," "CRM implementation," and "HubSpot vs. Salesforce"–the fan-out queries–that competitor's *corpus* will be retrieved more frequently and will more heavily influence the final synthesized answer.

This mandates a strategic shift: from optimizing individual posts to building comprehensive **topic clusters**, or a hub-and-spoke corpus, designed to cover the entire "semantic neighborhood" the fan-out will explore.

## Optimizing for Chatbots vs. API Models

This is the critical, high-level distinction that separates amateur GEO from professional strategy. You are not optimizing for "AI"; you are fighting a war on two separate fronts, and each requires a different playbook.

<Admonition type="tip" title="The Two-Front War">
* **Consumer Chat Apps (e.g., ChatGPT Search).** These are feature-rich *products* that come with *tools*. Their most important tool is [live web search (via Bing)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/). When you ask ChatGPT a real-time question, it performs that search-and-synthesis pipeline. Visibility here is a **real-time battle for *citability***, and it depends heavily on freshness, Bing indexing, and clear content structure.

* **Raw API Models (e.g., GPT-4o via API).** These are the raw *engines* that developers build on top of. When accessed via API, [the model has *no* automatic web access](https://zapier.com/blog/chatgpt-vs-gpt/). Its knowledge is confined to its (massive) **training data**. Visibility here is a **long-term battle for *brand encoding***, or "rememberability."
</Admonition>

This dichotomy resolves the most confusing, conflicting advice in the GEO space.
Some experts will tell you: "Focus on technical SEO, freshness, and Bing indexing." Others will tell you: "Links matter less; focus on [unlinked brand mentions, PR, and getting into Wikipedia](https://ahrefs.com/blog/ai-overview-brand-correlation/)."

Both are correct. They are just talking about different battlefields.

The "freshness and Bing" strategy is the playbook for winning **Front 1 (Real-Time Citability)**.
The "brand mentions and PR" strategy is the playbook for winning **Front 2 (Long-Term Brand Encoding)**. Your brand and expertise get "baked in" to the model's foundational knowledge.

A complete GEO strategy must run these two tracks in parallel. Most companies are failing because they are only focused on one, or neither.

## New Signals of Authority in the GEO Era

With this two-front framework, the new "ranking factors" for AI become clear and logical. Early analyses converge on three practical signals that matter most.

### Brand Web Mentions (Earned Media)

This is the standout signal for winning **Front 2 (Brand Encoding)**. Large-scale studies of Google's AI Overviews show that **unlinked brand mentions** correlate far more strongly with AI visibility than classic link metrics. Links still matter (for crawling and PageRank), but mentions are the primary signal of *authority* for a language model.

An LLM is a *semantic* engine. A hyperlink is a *navigational* signal for a crawler. A sentence in an authoritative publication that says, "According to research..." is a powerful *semantic* signal of authority that an LLM can easily ingest, understand, and learn from.

### Depth + Structure-for-Extraction

This is the key to winning **Front 1 (Real-Time Citability)**. The goal is not "word count"; it is *semantic legibility*. Studies show that long, **fact-dense** pages that directly answer questions are far easier for models to parse, summarize, and cite during the synthesis step.

You must structure your content to be the *perfect, pre-packaged answer* for the AI's retrieval pipeline. This means using:

* Clear H2/H3 headings
* Bulleted and numbered lists
* Concise, thirty to fifty word direct answers in the first paragraph of a section
* FAQ sections with explicit question-and-answer pairs

### SEO Fundamentals are Prerequisites

This is the non-negotiable foundation for **Front 1**. [**You can't be cited if you can't be crawled.**](https://a16z.com/geo-over-seo/) All the advanced content strategy in the world is useless if a misconfigured robots.txt file is blocking GPTBot or your site is not fully indexed by Bing.

SEO craftsmanship–Bing indexing, sitemaps, clean information architecture, site speed, and schema markup (FAQPage, HowTo, Organization)–remains table stakes.

## Actionable GEO Playbook

This framework translates into a concrete, four-part playbook.

### Content for AI Citation

* **Do "Fan-Out Research":** Use Perplexity or ChatGPT Search to inspect the related questions, comparisons, and angles the engine surfaces for your core topics. These are your sub-pages.
* **Ship a Hub-and-Spoke Corpus:** Build one "pillar" overview page and link it tightly to detailed "spoke" pages that each nail a specific fan-out query.
* **Write for Extraction:** Start every section with a thirty to fifty word direct answer. Use scannable lists, tables, and explicit Q→A pairs in an FAQ block.

### Make Your Site Legible to AI

* **Bing First:** Verify your site in Bing Webmaster Tools, submit your sitemaps, and fix all crawl errors. This is the price of admission for ChatGPT Search.
* **Let AI Crawlers In:** Review your robots.txt file to ensure you explicitly Allow agents like GPTBot and ClaudeBot to access your public content (blog, docs, resources).
* **Add Schema:** Implement Organization, FAQPage, HowTo, Product, and Article schema. This is a direct, machine-readable way to tell AI what your content is.

### Manufacture "Rememberability"

* **Prioritize Earned Media:** Focus PR efforts on analyst mentions, third-party reviews, and authoritative write-ups. These unlinked mentions are training data gold.
* **Be Present in Training-Rich Communities:** Earn a presence in high-signal forums, academic citations, and Wikipedia (if notable). These are known to be heavily weighted in training corpora.

### Platform Nuances

Different engines have different preferences. A mature strategy accounts for them.

<Window title="Platform-Specific Strategies">

**Google AI Overviews:** Acts as a hybrid. Classic SEO rankings still gatekeep *eligibility*. Passage-level clarity and strong E-E-A-T signals win the *selection* for the AI-generated answer.

**ChatGPT (Search):** Heavily influenced by **Bing** results. Prioritize content that is easy to summarize and cite quickly.

**Perplexity:** Tends to cite a more diverse set of sources. This is an excellent target for niche experts who publish deep, comprehensive explainers.

</Window>

### Measure What Matters

Stop obsessing over "Position #1." Start tracking the KPIs that matter for GEO.

* **Share of AI Voice:** For your priority user intents, what percentage of AI answers include your brand?
* **Citation Rate & Placement:** How often are your URLs directly cited, and where?
* **Corpus Coverage:** What percentage of your topic's "fan-out" queries have you shipped strong pages for?
* **Freshness:** Keep a clear update cadence for data-sensitive pages, as this heavily influences real-time citability.

## Example: From "Ranked" to "Cited"

Let's see this in action with a hypothetical small business: a local craft brewery.

### Before: The Old SEO Model

* **Action:** The brewery wrote one big, 3,000-word blog post: "The Best IPAs in Austin."
* **Goal:** Rank #1 on Google for that single, high-volume keyword.
* **The Problem:** A user asks ChatGPT, "What's a good brewery in East Austin with a dog-friendly patio and good IPAs?" The AI performs a "Query Fan-Out" for "breweries east austin," "dog-friendly patios austin," and "best IPAs austin."
* **Result:** The brewery's single post is missed. The AI synthesizes an answer from Yelp, a different blog that *did* mention the patio, and a city guide. The brewery isn't cited and gets no visibility.

### After: The New GEO Model

* **Action:** The brewery builds a "Hub-and-Spoke" topic cluster.
  * **Hub Page:** "The Ultimate Guide to Our Austin Brewery"
  * **Spoke 1:** "Our Core IPA Lineup (Tasting Notes & Stats)"
  * **Spoke 2:** "Visit Our Dog-Friendly Patio (East Austin Location & Hours)"
  * **Spoke 3:** "Brewery Events & Taproom-Only Releases"
* **Technical Action:** They submit their sitemap to Bing Webmaster Tools, add FAQPage schema to their guide, and ensure their robots.txt explicitly allows GPTBot.
* **Result:** When the AI performs the *same* "Query Fan-Out," it retrieves the brewery's "spoke" pages for multiple sub-queries. During the "Synthesis & Grounding" step, the AI sees the brewery's site as a comprehensive, authoritative source for all parts of the user's request. It confidently writes the answer and **cites the brewery's website** as the source.

## Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs

Avoid these common traps that stall most GEO strategies:

<Admonition type="warning" title="Common GEO Mistakes">
* **Ignoring Front 2:** Focusing 100% on Bing indexing and technical SEO (Front 1) while completely ignoring the long-term "Brand Encoding" (Front 2) that comes from PR, unlinked mentions, and authoritative citations.
* **Blocking Your Best Asset:** Misconfiguring your robots.txt file and blocking GPTBot, ClaudeBot, or other AI crawlers from accessing your content, making you invisible.
* **Writing Posts, Not Corpora:** Shipping one-off "hero" blog posts instead of building comprehensive "Hub-and-Spoke" topic clusters designed to answer the entire "Query Fan-Out".
* **Chasing Links, Not Mentions:** Over-valuing traditional backlinks while under-valuing the power of unlinked brand mentions in authoritative publications, which are a primary signal of authority for LLMs.
* **Writing "Narrative" Instead of "Answers":** Crafting long, narrative prose that humans might enjoy but that machines struggle to parse. You must shift to "structure-for-extraction" with scannable lists, tables, and Q&A pairs.
* **Using a One-Size-Fits-All Strategy:** Treating Google AI Overviews (which is still gated by classic SEO rankings) the same as ChatGPT Search (which relies on Bing) or Perplexity (which cites more diverse sources).
</Admonition>

## Become an "API-able Brand"

The current GEO paradigm is focused on influencing AI *answers*. This is just the beginning. The next evolution of this technology is **autonomous agents**–AI that moves from *answering* to *acting*.

Users won't ask, "What are the best-value hotels in Austin?" They will command, "Book me the best-value hotel in Austin for my trip next week."

In that world, the AI agent won't *cite* a blog post about hotels. It will **call an API** from a booking service.

The ultimate future-proofing strategy is to think beyond content and expose your core business logic–your catalog, pricing, availability, and booking functions–as machine-readable APIs. The goal is to be *callable by agents*, not just citable by models.

GEO today is about **citations**. GEO tomorrow will be about **invocations**.

## TL;DR

* Optimize to be **used in the answer**, not just listed under it.
* Win two games at once: **citability now** (fresh, Bing-visible, structured) and **memory later** (brand mentions, reference content).
* **Ship corpora, not posts.** Design your content to cover the "query fan-out."
* Keep your SEO craftsmanship. **Technical legibility** is the price of admission.
* Expose APIs. The endgame is being **callable by agents**.

## Actionable Assets For Your Toolkit

### The Complete GEO Audit Checklist

<Collapsible title="Content for AI Citation (Corpus & Structure)">

- **Fan-out research done** for each priority topic (inspect related sub-queries via Perplexity / ChatGPT Search) and documented.
- **Pillar + spokes shipped**: one overview page + dedicated sub-pages for each fan-out query.
- **Extraction-first writing**: every section starts with a thirty to fifty word direct answer; uses clear H2/H3s, bullets, tables, and an FAQ (explicit Q→A pairs).
- **Entity clarity**: consistent names for company, product SKUs, features, and key nouns (helps NER and citation mapping).
- **Reference-grade assets**: glossaries, methodologies, datasets, benchmarks that third parties can cite.
- **Author E-E-A-T visible**: expert bylines, credentials, dated updates, and sources at the bottom of pages.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Technical GEO (Crawlability & Interpretability)">

- **Bing Webmaster Tools**: site verified, sitemaps submitted, crawl errors resolved.
- **Sitemaps** include all pillar/spoke URLs; auto-regenerate on publish.
- **robots.txt** allows key AI crawlers (see snippet below); security middleware isn't blocking them.
- **Schema** in place where relevant: FAQPage, HowTo, Product, Organization, Article, BreadcrumbList.
- **Performance**: fast TTFB (under 500ms target), stable CLS, good LCP; pages render fully without client-only content gating.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<Collapsible title="What is the difference between SEO and GEO?">
**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of engineering pages to *rank* on a list of links, with the goal of winning a *click*. **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** is the practice of structuring content to be *used and cited* inside an AI-generated answer, with the goal of becoming the *source*.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Is SEO dead now?">
**No, but its role has changed.** SEO fundamentals are now the non-negotiable *prerequisite* for GEO. Technical SEO, site speed, clean architecture, and authority are "table stakes". You can't be cited by an AI (GEO) if you can't be crawled and indexed by a search engine (SEO) in the first place.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How do I let AI crawlers see my site?">
You must explicitly Allow them in your **robots.txt** file. Many websites block these crawlers by default. You should add specific directives to allow agents like GPTBot (OpenAI's crawler) and ClaudeBot (Anthropic's crawler) to access your public content, as shown in the snippet in this article.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How is GEO different from AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?">
They are related but different in scope. **AEO** typically focuses on optimizing for *direct answer boxes* and featured snippets in traditional search (like "People Also Ask"). **GEO** is a broader, "Two-Front War". It includes AEO-like tactics for "Front 1" (real-time citability) but *also* adds the critical long-term strategy for "Front 2" (brand encoding), which involves building brand authority to get "baked in" to the models themselves.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Should I focus on Google or Bing?">
**You need to focus on both, for different reasons.**

* **Google:** Its AI Overviews are still heavily influenced and gated by its classic SEO rankings. Strong traditional SEO is your ticket to play.
* **Bing:** It is the *direct search provider* for ChatGPT's live search feature. This makes a strong Bing indexing strategy absolutely critical for winning "Front 1" (real-time citability) in the world's most popular chatbot.
